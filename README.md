# Fetal Health Classification Project
Overview
This project aims to classify fetal health conditions based on physiological measurements. By using machine learning, it provides insights into potential health risks, supporting medical professionals in decision-making.

Project Goals
Analyze and preprocess fetal health data.
Compare multiple machine learning models to identify the best classifier for this problem.
Evaluate models based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Model Comparison
Four machine learning models were trained and evaluated on this dataset:

Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Support Vector Machine (SVM)	0.94	0.93	0.94	0.93
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)	0.90	0.89	0.90	0.89
Decision Tree	0.91	0.90	0.91	0.90
Random Forest	0.97	0.96	0.97	0.96
Conclusion: Among the evaluated models, the Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest performance, making it the best choice for this classification problem.
