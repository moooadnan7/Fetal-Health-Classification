# Fetal Health Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to classify fetal health conditions based on physiological measurements. By using machine learning, it provides insights into potential health risks, supporting medical professionals in decision-making.

## Project Goals
- Analyze and preprocess fetal health data.
- Compare multiple machine learning models to identify the best classifier for this problem.
- Evaluate models based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Data Analysis**: pandas, NumPy
  - **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
  - **Modeling**: scikit-learn
- **Other Tools**: Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding and visualization.

## Installation

2. Run the notebook step by step to:
   Perform data exploration and preprocessing.
   Train and evaluate models.
   Visualize performance metrics.
## Model Comparison

The following models were trained and evaluated on the dataset:

| Model                          | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Support Vector Machine (SVM)    | 0.94     | 0.93      | 0.94   | 0.93     |
| k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)       | 0.90     | 0.89      | 0.90   | 0.89     |
| Decision Tree                   | 0.91     | 0.90      | 0.91   | 0.90     |
| Random Forest                   | 0.97     | 0.96      | 0.97   | 0.96     |

## Conclusion:
Among the evaluated models, the **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the highest performance, making it the best choice for this classification problem.
